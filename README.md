# Dicegame
Dice game with ruby from makers academy mastery curriculum:

[**dicegame1.rb:**](https://github.com/m-rcd/Dicegame/blob/master/dicegame1.rb) write a simple dice game. (Game! You're probably going to need a loop of some sort.) The rules are:
If I roll higher than my opponent, I win.

[**dicegame2.rb:**](https://github.com/m-rcd/Dicegame/blob/master/dicegame2.rb) Upgrade the dice game: now both I and my opponent roll two six-sided dice each.

[**dicegame3.rb:**](https://github.com/m-rcd/Dicegame/blob/master/dicegame3.rb) Upgrade the game once more: now we play several rounds for each game. The first player to win two rounds wins the game. (Still with two dice each.)
